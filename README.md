# Introduction to Machine Learning
## formerly known as Introduction to Pattern Recognition

As a part of a course Introduction to Machine Learning at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) we could have delivered 5 projects voluntarily. Therefore, I delivered these 5 projects based on the assignments reflecting 5 sub-topics:

1. [Fourier decomposition of a chirp signal](https://github.com/tmshts/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/tree/main/exercise-01)
2. [Image preprocessing using Otsu thresholding](https://github.com/tmshts/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/tree/main/exercise-02)
3. [Edge detection using Canny ED](https://github.com/tmshts/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/tree/main/exercise-03)
4. [Automatically-aligned Palmprint](https://github.com/tmshts/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/tree/main/exercise-04)
5. [Face generation from Eigenfaces](https://github.com/tmshts/Introduction_to_Machine_Learning/tree/main/exercise-05)
