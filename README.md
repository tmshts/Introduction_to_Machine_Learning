# Introduction to Machine Learning
## formerly known as Introduction to Pattern Recognition

As a part of a course Introduction to Machine Learning at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) we could have delivered 5 projects voluntarily. Therefore, I delivered these 5 projects based on the assignments reflecting 5 sub-topics:

1. Fourier decomposition of a chirp signal
2. Image preprocessing using Otsu thresholding
3. Edge detection using Canny ED
4. Automatically-aligned Palmprint
5. Face generation from Eigenfaces
