# Introduction to Machine Learning
## formerly known as Introduction to Pattern Recognition

One of the goals of the course Introduction to Machine Learning was to do 5 projects. These 5 projects reflect the 5 sub-topics:

1. Fourier decomposition of a chirp signal
2. Image preprocessing using Otsu thresholding
3. Edge detection using Canny ED
4. Automatically-aligned Palmprint
5. Face generation from Eigenfaces
